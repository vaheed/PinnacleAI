## MVP Prototype: Directory Structure & Sample Code

This section provides a conceptual "on-paper" MVP prototype, outlining how the PinnacleAI Orchestrator might be structured and function at a basic level. The directory layout, code architecture, and sample snippets are designed to clarify how different components interact, without yet committing to a specific programming language, frameworks, or cloud infrastructure. These details will evolve as we move from prototype to production.

### Goals of the MVP Prototype
- **Demonstrate Modular Design**: Show how orchestrator logic, agents, RL policies, and prompt management are separated into cleanly defined modules.
- **Establish Clear Contracts**: Each agent, policy, and prompt manager component follows a well-defined interface.
- **Enable Iterative Development**: The structure allows for easy swapping or addition of new agents, prompts, or RL policies without extensive rewrites.
- **Support Testing and Documentation**: Organized directories for tests, docs, and configuration make it easier to maintain quality and provide transparency.

# How the MVP Works (Conceptual Flow)

## User Request
A user issues a request, e.g., “Translate this text into English, then summarize the result.”

## Meta-Agent Orchestration
The `meta_agent.py` reads the `orchestrator_config.yaml` to determine the task sequence. It invokes the `prompt_manager.py` to choose or generate the best prompt for each agent.

## Prompt Selection and Adaptation
The `prompt_manager.py` selects a prompt from `prompts_config.yaml`, possibly running A/B tests or adapting based on user profile or context.

## Agent Execution
1. The `translation_agent.py` receives a prompt and returns translated text.
2. The `summarization_agent.py` then receives the translated text and returns a summary.

## Reinforcement Learning Feedback Loop
After the user receives the final output, they provide structured feedback (e.g., rating the quality, noting missing details).
- `feedback_processor.py` integrates this feedback into the RL state via `state_representation.py`.
- The chosen `policy.py` uses `reward_functions.py` to adjust future decision-making.

## Continuous Improvement
Over time, RL training scripts in `training_scripts.py` periodically update the policy weights, stored in `model_storage/`, improving orchestration decisions and prompt selection.

## Sample Code Snippets

### Meta-Agent Coordination (Pseudocode)
```python
# src/orchestrator/meta_agent.py

from orchestrator.prompt_manager import PromptManager
from agents.translation_agent import TranslationAgent
from agents.summarization_agent import SummarizationAgent
from utils.logger import Logger
from utils.config_loader import ConfigLoader
from rl.policy import OrchestrationPolicy
from orchestrator.feedback_processor import FeedbackProcessor

class MetaAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.config = ConfigLoader.load("config/orchestrator_config.yaml")
        self.policy = OrchestrationPolicy.load("src/rl/model_storage/policy_checkpoint.pt")
        self.prompt_manager = PromptManager()
        self.translation_agent = TranslationAgent()
        self.summarization_agent = SummarizationAgent()
        self.feedback_processor = FeedbackProcessor()
        self.logger = Logger()

    def handle_request(self, user_input, user_id=None):
        # Example: Decide on a chain of tasks based on policy or static config
        steps = self.config.get("default_sequence", ["translate", "summarize"])

        current_text = user_input
        for step in steps:
            prompt = self.prompt_manager.get_prompt(step, context=current_text, user_id=user_id)
            if step == "translate":
                current_text = self.translation_agent.perform_task(prompt)
            elif step == "summarize":
                current_text = self.summarization_agent.perform_task(prompt, input_text=current_text)

        self.logger.log("info", f"Final output: {current_text}")
        return current_text

    def incorporate_feedback(self, feedback, original_request, final_output):
        # Convert feedback into a reward signal
        reward = self.feedback_processor.calculate_reward(feedback, original_request, final_output)
        # Update RL policy with new experience
        self.policy.update(reward)
        self.logger.log("info", f"Policy updated with reward: {reward}")
```

### Prompt Management with Contextual Adaptation
```python
# src/orchestrator/prompt_manager.py

import random
from utils.config_loader import ConfigLoader

class PromptManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prompts_config = ConfigLoader.load("config/prompts_config.yaml")

    def get_prompt(self, agent_task, context, user_id=None):
        # Retrieve candidate prompts for given task
        candidate_prompts = self.prompts_config.get(agent_task, [])
        
        # Simple A/B test logic: choose one at random (could be weighted or RL-driven)
        chosen_prompt_template = random.choice(candidate_prompts)
        
        # Context adaptation: Insert user context or domain hints if available
        # For now, we just append context, but a real system might adjust language tone, etc.
        prompt = chosen_prompt_template.format(context=context)

        return prompt

```

### Sample prompts_config.yaml:
```yaml
translate:
  - "Translate the following text into English:\n{context}"
  - "Please provide an English translation for the text:\n{context}"

summarize:
  - "Summarize the following content succinctly:\n{context}"
  - "Please create a concise summary of the text:\n{context}"

```


## Example Agent Implementation

### Translation Agent
```python
# src/agents/translation_agent.py

class TranslationAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # In a real MVP, this might call a translation model endpoint or API.
        pass

    def perform_task(self, prompt):
        # Pseudo-logic: Assume a translation model is invoked here
        translated_text = mock_translation_model_api(prompt)
        return translated_text

def mock_translation_model_api(input_text):
    # Pretend this calls an actual model.
    return "This is the translated version of the input text."
```

## Example Agent Implementation

### Summarization Agent

```python
# src/agents/summarization_agent.py

class SummarizationAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def perform_task(self, prompt, input_text):
        # Similar to translation agent, call summarization API or model.
        summarized_text = mock_summarize_model_api(input_text)
        return summarized_text

def mock_summarize_model_api(text):
    # Mock function that returns a fixed summary.
    return "This is a concise summary of the translated content."

```

### Reinforcement Learning Policy Example

```python
# src/rl/policy.py

class OrchestrationPolicy:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model  # model could be a PyTorch or TF model in a real MVP

    @staticmethod
    def load(model_path):
        # For the MVP, pretend we load a trained model.
        return OrchestrationPolicy(model=None)

    def update(self, reward):
        # Pseudo-logic to adjust the policy based on received reward.
        pass

```

### Feedback Processing and Reward Calculation

```python
# src/orchestrator/feedback_processor.py

from rl.reward_functions import compute_reward_from_feedback

class FeedbackProcessor:
    def calculate_reward(self, feedback, original_request, final_output):
        return compute_reward_from_feedback(feedback, original_request, final_output)

```

### Sample Reward Function
```python
# src/rl/reward_functions.py

def compute_reward_from_feedback(feedback, original_request, final_output):
    rating = feedback.get("rating", 0)  # Assume rating is in {1..5}, 5 = best
    reward = rating - 3

    if feedback.get("missing_info"):
        reward -= 1

    return reward


```

### Notes on this "On-Paper" MVP

  - Mocked Functions: We use mock_translation_model_api and mock_summarize_model_api to simulate agent outputs. In a real system, these would interface with language models or other ML endpoints.
  - Stubbed RL Updates: The RL policy’s update method is a placeholder.
  - Config and Logging: Config files allow easy reconfiguration of sequences, prompts, and RL parameters.
